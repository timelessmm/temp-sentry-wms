# Sentry WMS

**Open-source warehouse management system built for e-commerce.**

Sentry is the link between the warehouse floor and your system of record. It connects barcode scans, pick tasks, and inventory movements to whatever database or ERP your business runs on.

## What Sentry Does

- **Receiving** - Scan PO barcodes, verify items, stage for put-away
- **Put-Away** - Suggested bin placement, scan-to-confirm storage
- **Picking** - Multi-order batch picking with optimized walk paths
- **Packing** - Scan-to-verify pack station (separate screen from shipping)
- **Shipping** - Carrier/tracking entry, fulfillment recording (separate screen from packing)
- **Cycle Counting** - Bin-level counts with variance detection
- **Bin Transfers** - Move inventory between locations
- **Inter-Warehouse Transfers** - Cross-warehouse inventory moves with audit trail
- **Inventory Adjustments** - Direct add/remove with reason tracking
- **Connector Framework** - Pluggable ERP / commerce sync (orders, items, inventory, fulfillment) with encrypted credential vault, health dashboard, and circuit-breaker-protected outbound calls

## What Sentry Is Not

Sentry is not an ERP. It does not manage orders, products, or customers. It connects to your existing systems (NetSuite, QuickBooks, SAP, or any ERP with an API) and handles the physical warehouse execution layer.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Mobile App | React Native (Expo)  -  shared hooks (`useScreenError`), reusable components (`ScreenHeader`, `ModeSelector`, `ScanInput`) |
| API | Python / Flask  -  `@with_db` middleware, `inventory_service` + `picking_service` service layer, `constants.py` status enums |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 (dev Docker) · PostgreSQL Cloud (prod) |
| Admin Panel | React Web App  -  dark theme, warehouse context picker, `WarehouseContext` provider |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/hightower-systems/sentry-wms.git
cd sentry-wms

# Copy environment config and generate required secrets
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and set each of:
#   JWT_SECRET            -- openssl rand -hex 32
#   SENTRY_ENCRYPTION_KEY -- python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
#   REDIS_PASSWORD        -- python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
# Startup hard-fails if any of these are missing.

# Start PostgreSQL + API + Admin Panel + Redis + Celery worker
docker compose up -d

# Or start with a clean system (no demo data):
# SKIP_SEED=true docker compose up -d

# API is now running at http://localhost:5000
# Admin panel is now running at http://localhost:8080
# Health check: http://localhost:5000/api/health
# Admin login is admin/admin on fresh installs (forced password change on first login)

# For local development with Vite dev-server and hot reload:
# docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Start the mobile app (separate terminal)
cd mobile
cp .env.example .env    # Set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL to your machine's IP
npm install
npx expo start
```

## Admin Panel

The admin panel is a React web app for warehouse managers to monitor operations and configure the system.

- **Dashboard** - pipeline overview, open orders, low stock alerts, recent activity
- **Inventory** - full inventory view with search and pagination
- **Cycle Counts** - create and track bin-level counts
- **Receiving / Put-Away / Picking / Packing / Shipping** - workflow status views
- **Bins / Zones / Items** - warehouse setup with create, edit, and detail views
- **Adjustments** - direct inventory add/remove with reason tracking
- **Inter-Warehouse Transfers** - move inventory between warehouses
- **Users** - user management with role assignment
- **Audit Log** - filterable log viewer with entity name resolution
- **Import** - CSV/JSON bulk import for items, bins, POs, SOs with templates
- **Settings** - warehouse config, manual PO/SO entry, fulfillment workflow toggles, connector setup (credential form + sync health dashboard)
- **Warehouse Picker** - header dropdown to switch warehouse context (all pages filter dynamically)

Built with React 19, Vite, React Router, and plain CSS. Dark theme with copper accents. No component libraries.

## Database

### Bin Types

Sentry uses 3 bin types that control whether the pick algorithm can pull inventory:

| Type | Pickable? | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `Staging` | No | Inbound dock, QC hold. Inventory lands here on receipt. Put-away moves it out. |
| `PickableStaging` | Yes | Staging area where admin allows pickers to pull fresh inventory before formal put-away. |
| `Pickable` | Yes | Standard shelf bins, bulk storage, shipping desk. Default for most bins. |

### Test Lab Seed Data

The apartment lab seed (`db/seed-apartment-lab.sql`) matches 61 printed Zebra barcode labels:

- 2 warehouses, 6 zones, 16 bins
- 20 items (fly fishing catalog, TST-001 through TST-020)
- 5 purchase orders (10/3/8/5/1 lines)
- 20 sales orders (single-item, multi-item, contention, serpentine walk, short pick test)

Set `SKIP_SEED=true` to start with a clean system (admin user + one empty warehouse only, no demo data).

### Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full policy, [SECURITY_BACKLOG.md](SECURITY_BACKLOG.md) for the
deferred-findings roadmap, and the `v1.3.0` entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the
per-finding list closed in this release. Highlights:

- All secrets (`JWT_SECRET`, `SENTRY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`) required at startup;
  containers hard-fail on missing values
- Encrypted credential vault (Fernet) for connector secrets; values are never returned in API
  responses or logs
- Audit log is append-only with a SHA-256 chain hash; `verify_audit_log_chain()` detects any
  retroactive edit
- Row-level locks on inventory mutations (receive, pick, allocate, move) prevent over-receipt
  and oversell under concurrency
- Tenant isolation is enforced in SQL: non-admin lookups return the same 404 for
  wrong-warehouse as they do for missing records (no existence oracle)
- Connector outbound HTTP guarded by an SSRF allowlist (blocks private/loopback/link-local
  IPs and internal docker hostnames)
- Login lockout is IP-scoped so a remote attacker cannot DoS a known username
- Admin panel is a production nginx multi-stage build (Vite dev-server only available in the
  `docker-compose.dev.yml` overlay); runs as `USER nginx`
- Redis broker requires `--requirepass`; Celery uses the authenticated URL
- CSV import runs through pydantic with formula-injection guards on text fields
- All SQL uses parameterized bindings; response headers set nosniff / DENY / strict-origin
  Referrer-Policy / restrictive Permissions-Policy

### Testing

647 backend tests using transaction-rollback isolation (savepoint per test, rollback after).
Runs in ~18 seconds. 24 are infrastructure-config tests that correctly skip when the suite
runs inside the api container.

```bash
docker compose exec api python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

## Project Status

**v1.9.0 - "Dockd shipping integration" release. Adds a dedicated outbound shipping API for the in-warehouse dockd application: three endpoints under `/api/v1/dockd/orders/<so_number>` (GET, ship, void-ship) authenticated by per-station bearer tokens with the new `dockd.dispatch` scope, idempotent under retry through SHA-256 body-hash sentinel rows, and serialized against concurrent shipment via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the SO. Both ship and void-ship write through the existing audit-log hash chain and emit on the `integration_events` outbox; new `ship.voided/1` event reverts a SHIPPED SO back to PICKED or PACKED. SO lifecycle gains `CANCELLED` status with end-to-end wiring (admin + inbound + dashboard counter) -- ERP-driven cancels release allocation pre-PICK and revert inventory to default receiving bin for PICKED / PACKED orders. New `sales_orders.memo` column inbound-mappable from connector and rendered through picker / packer / shipper flows. Audit Log page modernized with color-coded action badges, chip-style detail previews, action-type select filter, and Copy JSON button on the detail modal; PICK / TO_LINE_PICKED / PACK / RECEIVE audit details now record both expected and actual counts. Two migrations (054-055).**
