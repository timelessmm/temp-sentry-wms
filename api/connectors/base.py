"""Base connector interface and result types for ERP/commerce integrations.

This module defines the contract that all Sentry WMS connectors must implement.
Connectors bridge external systems (NetSuite, BigCommerce, Shopify, etc.) with
the WMS by providing a standard interface for syncing orders, items, inventory,
and pushing fulfillment data back to the source system.

Result types use pydantic for validation and serialization.
