# v1.5.1 V-208 (#141): wms_tokens lifecycle actions. Admin token CRUD
# (issue, rotate, revoke, delete) writes one audit_log row per call
# so post-incident forensics can reconstruct "who issued what and
# when" even if the DB row itself is later deleted. The v1.4 hash
# chain trigger on audit_log makes the trail tamper-evident.
# Plaintext token values NEVER appear in `details`; scope snapshots
# do, so delete can be audited after the row is gone.

# (V-207 replay, V-204 subscription tampering) rather than an auth
# bypass. Worth filing for forensic symmetry: without these writes,
# an attacker could delete + recreate a consumer_group with a
# tampered subscription (V-204) and leave no audit trace.

# table column is INT; subscription_id is UUID, so writes use a
