"""
V-024: periodic cleanup of ephemeral tables.

login_attempts accumulates one row per unique rate-limit key (user or
IP). Without a cleanup job the table grows unbounded under a spraying
attack. This task runs on the Celery beat schedule and deletes rows
older than 1 hour (beyond the lockout window).

v1.6.0 adds two webhook tasks: a 90-day retention sweep on terminal
``webhook_deliveries`` rows and an hourly prune of expired
``webhook_secrets`` (generation=2 rows whose dual-accept window has
ended).

v1.7.0 adds the Pipe B inbound source_payload retention task (R6).
inbound_<resource>.source_payload is the original consumer-shaped JSON
the canonical row was derived from. After
SENTRY_INBOUND_SOURCE_PAYLOAD_RETENTION_DAYS (default 90, hard floor
7 days; V-201 shape) the retention task NULLs out source_payload while
preserving canonical_payload, dropping the bulk of per-row size while
keeping the canonical history queryable. One inbound_cleanup_runs row
per (resource, run) tuple records the start/finish/rows_nullified so
operators can detect a partial-failure shape (one resource succeeds,
another aborts on a lock-timeout).
