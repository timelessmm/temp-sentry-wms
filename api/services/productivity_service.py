"""Productivity dashboard aggregations (v1.8.0 #297).

Reads from audit_log (canonical "who did what"), not from
integration_events (the outbox for downstream consumers). The
ix_audit_log_dashboard covering index landed in mig 051 (#283)
keeps cold-cache p95 under 500ms over a 30-day window with ~100k
audit rows.

Five event kinds, each with its own metric:

  picking       SUM(details.quantity_picked)
  packing       SUM(details.total_items)
  received_skus COUNT(DISTINCT details.item_id)
  putaway_skus  COUNT(DISTINCT entity_id) WHERE entity_type='ITEM'
  shipped       COUNT(*)

Per-action SQL is preferred over a single aggregator because the
audit_log details JSONB shape varies per action (the field-path
heterogeneity is documented at the call sites; centralising it in
the service module keeps the dashboard query honest about each
metric's origin).

60s in-process TTL cache absorbs repeat hits from the handful of
admins who refresh. Pattern adapted from token_cache without the
cross-worker pubsub layer (60s staleness across workers is fine
for a refresh-driven view).

Packing visibility honours app_settings.require_packing_before_
shipping; when False, the packing event is excluded from the
response so the UI does not render a perpetually-zero card.
